raw_context = """ Twelve years later, Titanic creator James Cameron yet 
again delivers a great science fiction extravaganza with the usual tropes and clichés of a 
"good guy" who must overcome a battle with his own morals to do what's right, 
but somehow making it all work beautifully. The characters, the musical score for every scene, 
the beauty and uniqueness of the flora and fauna of Pandora, living forests, thundering waterfalls, nimble beasts, 
flying dragon-birds, and the way cultures of the Na'vis is portrayed will truly keep you captivated and leave you beyond impressed."""
