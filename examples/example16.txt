=== FINAL SUMMARY ===
Ronaldo is fairly well-suited for the striking position, with a suitability score of approximately 0.77, indicating he is likely a good fit for this role.




raw_context = """Ronaldo has better left foot, right foot, height and header ability in comparison with Lewandowski, 
he has all of that aspects slightly better, while lewandowski has better positioning and technique. Good Striker requires 
good usage of both foot, good header ability, good positioning and technique! """
