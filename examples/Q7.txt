[INFO] Reasoning mode: no
[INFO] Tool execution result: In a triangle, the sum of the interior angles is always 180 degrees. In triangle ABC, we have:

- Angle A = 60 degrees
- Angle B = 50 degrees

To find Angle C, we can use the formula:

Angle C = 180 degrees - (Angle A + Angle B)

Substituting the given values:

Angle C = 180 degrees - (60 degrees + 50 degrees)
Angle C = 180 degrees - 110 degrees
Angle C = 70 degrees

Therefore, the measure of Angle C is 70 degrees.

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===
The measure of Angle C is 70 degrees.
