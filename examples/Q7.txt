[INFO] Reasoning mode: no
[INFO] Tool execution result: In triangle ABC, the sum of the interior angles is always 180 degrees. Therefore, to find the measure of angle C, we can use the following calculation:

Angle C = 180 degrees - Angle A - Angle B  
Angle C = 180 degrees - 60 degrees - 50 degrees  
Angle C = 180 degrees - 110 degrees  
Angle C = 70 degrees

Thus, the measurement of angle C is 70 degrees.

=== FINAL SUMMARY ===
The measurement of angle C is 70 degrees.
